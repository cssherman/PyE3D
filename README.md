Python interface for the finite difference code E3D


Prerequisites:
1) Python 2.7
2) NumPy
3) SciPy
4) MatPlotLib
5) ffmpeg (required for video outputs)


Running the code:

The PyE3D GUI is launched from the file "e3d_gui.py".  It generates a configuration file "e3d_default.pkl" using
python pickle format, which is then used to create velocity models, run simulations, and render outputs.
